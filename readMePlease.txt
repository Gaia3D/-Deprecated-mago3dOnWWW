- abstract

This plugin is for visualization of indoor 3D model, F4D invented by Gaia3d


- how to use

As "howToUseThis.png" shows, just copy the folder "f4d" into the root of WWW project

and access to "/f4d/F4DProjects.html".


- WARNIING

This plugin must be used with sample data now.

(In "HowToUseThis.png", you can see the folder "F4D_GeometryData" right under "f4d".)

But, the sample data can't be opened yet because of license issues from the owners of origin 3D data.

Using this plugin without sample data will cause your web browser to be stuck.

(This plugin is under development. Not yet stable now.)

Please use this sources just as reference.
